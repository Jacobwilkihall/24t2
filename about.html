        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The Southland Boys' High School Robotics Club was established in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. J Andrew Welsman. Initially comprising just five members, one of the earliest enthusiasts was Jacob Wilkinson-Hall, who assumed the mantle of student leader from 2020 to 2023 (November). In 2021, the club ventured into fundraising by selling chocolate to finance its participation in the VEX VRC & IQR games. Over the course of the year, the club engaged in three online competitions: the poster challenge, adeptly tackled by Dyllan Quiri and Jacob Wilkinson-Hall; the reverse engineering challenge, also tackled by the dynamic duo; and a project on robotics in the medical field, led by Oshadha Perera. However, the year 2023 brought unfortunate news - it was announced that Mr. Welsman would be relocating to Australia, marking the end of his tenure with the club. With his departure at the end of term 1, the club found itself without guidance for two terms. Yet, in term 3, week 6, Jacob Wilkinson-Hall rose to the occasion, assuming the role of club leader with the assistance of Mrs. Sales. Through their concerted efforts, the club underwent a revival, swelling its ranks to 31 members - a record high. As the calendar flipped to 2024, Jacob Wilkinson-Hall continued to steer the club, now with Lachlan Bradley taking up the mantle of year 8 leader.</p>
